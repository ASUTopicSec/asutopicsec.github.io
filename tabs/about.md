ASU TopicSec is the site used for ASU's [SEFCOM](https://sefcom.asu.edu/) reading group and the Fall
2020 CSE591 reading classes posts on relevant topics and papers to the security
community. This year we have three teams:

- Team Fable
- Team Staple
- Team Olympic

All the teams are comprised of graduate students, as well as any SEFCOM
bystanders that wandered into the reading groups. We hope you enjoy the content
here
