## What is WebAssembly

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

In other words, JavaScript just isn't cutting it for some people. 
Compilers are cool, and so is C++. 
Let's compile our C++ to wasm, and then our client side code is fast, and we didn't have to write JavaScript: win, win.

## Everything Old is New Again
Buffer overflows are as old as time. 
C++ has buffer overflows, but JavaScript not so much (or at least lets pretend it doesn't, at worst its very rare).
This is exactly the problem that this paper investigates.
If we compile these memory unsafe languages to wasm, what are the security implications?

In terms of security, this paper splits describes two seperate security models.
The first, host security, is "the effectiveness of the runtime environment in protecting the host system against malicious WebAssembly code".
The second, binary security, is "the effectiveness of the built-in fault isolation mechanisms in preventing exploitation of otherwise benign WebAssembly code".
This paper focuses on the latter.
In other words, let's assume the virtual machine running wasm is safe and isn't going to allow us to suddenly start maliciously interacting with the host machine.
With that being said, what sorts of chaos can occur within the wasm vm, and what are the security implications?
