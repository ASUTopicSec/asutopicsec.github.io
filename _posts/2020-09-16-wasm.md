## What is WebAssembly

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.
[[1]](https://webassembly.org/)

In other words, JavaScript just isn't cutting it for some people. 
Compilers are cool, and so is C++. 
Let's compile our C++ to wasm, and then our client side code is fast, and we didn't have to write JavaScript: win, win.

## Everything Old is New Again

Buffer overflows are as old as time. 
C++ has buffer overflows, but JavaScript not so much (or at least lets pretend it doesn't, at worst its very rare).
This is exactly the problem that this paper investigates.
If we compile these memory unsafe languages to wasm, what are the security implications?

In terms of security, this paper splits describes two seperate security models.
The first, host security, is "the effectiveness of the runtime environment in protecting the host system against malicious WebAssembly code".
The second, binary security, is "the effectiveness of the built-in fault isolation mechanisms in preventing exploitation of otherwise benign WebAssembly code".
This paper focuses on the latter.
In other words, let's assume the virtual machine running wasm is safe and isn't going to allow us to suddenly start maliciously interacting with the host machine.
With that being said, what sorts of chaos can occur within the wasm vm, and what are the security implications?

## Binary Security of WebAssembly

This diagram gives a good overview of the modern standard security mitigations, and shows that a lot of security progress made over the last several decades have just been wiped away with wasm. 

But don't worry, because we don't need stack canaries and ASLR.
As the security document for wasm [[2]](https://webassembly.org/docs/security/) states,
> Since compiled code is immutable and not observable at runtime, WebAssembly programs are protected from control flow hijacking attacks.

Further, wasm has
> A protected call stack that is invulnerable to buffer overflows in the module heap ensures safe function returns.

Incredible.

### Types
As anyone that's ever used Haskell will tell you: you've got to have a sweet type system.
In wasm, there are four primitive types:  32 and 64 bit integers (i32, i64) and single and double precision floats (f32, f64).
More complex types, such as arrays, records, or designated pointers do not exist.

Amazing.

### Control-Flow
Unlike native code or Java bytecode, Web-Assembly has only structured control-flow.
No jumping to arbitrary addresses, you better know where you are going.

### Indirect Calls
But what if I don't know where I'm going to jump?
The `call_indirect` instruction pops a value from the stack, which it uses to index into the so called table section. 
Table entries map this index to a function, which is subsequently called.
You better put your function in the table.
Furthermore, you must specify the function signature in the instruction, and only call a function in the table with the same signature.

### Linear, Unmanaged Memory
The stack lives here (not that sweet protected one discussed before).
The heap lives here.
The global data lives here.
All right next to each other, all living in harmony.

### Host Environment
Without a host environment, nobody is going to hear the tree fall.
Browsers supply modules for functions such as `XmlHttpRequest`, `eval`, and `document.write`.
Modules running in Node.js may invoke `exec` to execute shell commands.
Non-primitive data, e.g. strings or objects, must be passed between host and WebAssembly module through linear memory, which can be accessed by both.
Hopefully nobody rampages through that linear memory and overwrites the precious buffer that you are about to send to `eval`.
Can you imagine?

### Managed vs Unmanaged Data
Managed data is first class.
It includes local variables, global variables, values on the evaluation stack, and return addresses.
The wasm VM cares for and nurtures this data.
It is truly a holy place to be.

The other scum is unmanaged data.
If Hindley and Milner can't figure you out because you're not an integer or a float (say, you're a string or an array), you get relegated to the linear memory.
Managed data is way beyond addresses.
If someone cares about your address, you get relegated to the linear memory.
Linear memory is a hellfire dump.
Don't end up in linear memory.
